# Guitar Chord Progressions and Fingerings Optimization

## Overview

The Guitar Chord Progressions and Fingerings Optimization system redefines the guitar playing experience by combining advanced algorithms with user-centric features. Designed for both beginners and seasoned guitarists, our system not only optimizes finger placements for smooth chord transitions but also introduces innovative features for a customized and enjoyable learning journey.

## Key Features

1. Optimal Finger Placement for Chord Transitions
Efficient Transitions: The system analyzes input chord sequences and recommends the best finger placement for each chord, prioritizing ease of transition and minimizing finger movement.
2. Music Theory-Based Chord Substitution
Song Style Preferences: Users can choose their preferred music style, such as Funk or Jazz. Leveraging music theory, the system identifies substitution chords that align with the selected style, offering a tailored chord progression.
3. Filtering Preferences for Playability
Customizable Playability: Recognizing that optimal finger placement may not always align with the best playing experience, users can filter preferences using three options:
Avoid Barre: Filters out barre chords for a more comfortable play.
Lower Fret Only: Limits fingerings to lower frets, avoiding higher and potentially challenging positions.
Less Fingers: Prioritizes fingerings that involve fewer fingers for simplicity.
4. Streamlit Web Interface
Accessible Interface: Explore our system through a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit. Visit our website here to experience seamless chord progression optimization and personalized fingerings.
